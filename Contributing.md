# Contributing

We welcome contribution from everyone. Here are some guidelines if you are thinking of contributing:

- Contributions to Rose or its dependencies should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
- Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.
- All contributions should follow this format, even those from core contributors.

## Pull request checklist

- All changes should happen through pull requests.

- Branch from the master branch before making changes. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.

## Philosophy

* Everything is a tradeoff. There is often more than one right answer.
* We take an iterative approach to engineering and design. The smaller the iteration loop, the faster and cheaper we can learn what works.
* We don't use the term "polish". It implies that quality is an afterthought.
* [We try to understand "why"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).
* We try to be pragmatic.
